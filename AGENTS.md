# AGENTS.md

Compact guide for OpenCode sessions in this repo.

## What this repo is

Python web service (`pyrkaiweb`) exposing RK-platform hardware / model SDKs
(`rkv`, `rkai`) over HTTP via FastAPI. Brand-new repo (no commits yet at
creation); everything below is verified against the current tree.

## Stack at a glance

- **Web framework**: FastAPI + Uvicorn (`run.py` boots `app.main:app` on
  `0.0.0.0:8000` with `reload=True`).
- **Internal SDKs** (installed editable from private SSH git, **not** PyPI):
  - `rkv` — Rockchip MPP / RGA2 / V4L2 video bindings.
    Native libs (`librockchip_mpp`, `librga`) must be installed on the host;
    `import rkv` only — `import rkv.video` is what touches the hardware.
  - `rkai` — RK-chip LLM / VLM SDK (transformers + opencv-python).
  See `.venv/src/rkv/AGENTS.md` and `.venv/src/rkai/pyproject.toml` for the
  SDK-side gotchas (they're external code, not in this repo, but the
  constraints propagate here).

## TL;DR commands

```bash
# activate (do NOT use system pip — Debian PEP 668 blocks it)
source .venv/bin/activate

# run
python run.py                  # 0.0.0.0:8000, reload on

# sanity
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
```

Endpoints wired so far: `GET /` (version), `GET /health`.

## One-time setup that an agent will get wrong

Both internal SDKs live behind SSH on `git@10.10.10.10`. They are **not** in
`requirements.txt` (intentional — the host SSH key + network decide whether
the install succeeds). Run them by hand after cloning:

```bash
.venv/bin/pip install -e "git+ssh://git@10.10.10.10/pythonsdk/pyrkv.git#egg=rkv"
.venv/bin/pip install -e "git+ssh://git@10.10.10.10/pythonsdk/pyrkai.git#egg=rkai"
```

If `git clone` fails, the host either lacks SSH access to `10.10.10.10` or
the deploy key isn't loaded. Do **not** fall back to a public mirror — these
SDKs aren't published.

`app/__init__.py` owns the single version string; bump it there when the
service version changes.

## Video detection page

The `#page-video-detection` section is wired to:

- **Backend** (`app/api/video_detection.py`):
  - `POST /api/video-detection/upload` — multipart file upload; saves to
    `app/services/uploads/<uuid><ext>` and returns `{upload_id, path, …}`.
  - `POST /api/video-detection/open` `{source: str}` — opens via
    `rkv.VideoCapture`, starts decode thread, returns snapshot.
  - `POST /api/video-detection/control` `{action: "play"|"pause"|"stop"}`.
  - `POST /api/video-detection/close`.
  - `GET  /api/video-detection` — current snapshot.
  - `GET  /api/video-detection/fs?path=…` — server-side directory
    listing (used by the in-page file picker modal). Constrained to
    `VD_FS_ROOT` (env var, default `/`) and skips `/proc`, `/sys`,
    `/dev`, `/run`, `/snap`, `/usr/share/{doc,locale,man}`, etc.
  - `POST /api/video-detection/prompt` `{prompt, every_n}` — start VLM
    detection with the user's prompt; `every_n` controls how often
    (in frames) the worker feeds a frame to the model.
  - `POST /api/video-detection/prompt/stop` — stop detection (worker
    thread exits, session stays loaded for next start).
  - `GET  /api/video-detection/events` — snapshot + history list + latest.
  - `POST /api/video-detection/events/clear` — clear history.
  - `WS   /api/video-detection/ws` — server-pushes binary JPEG frames;
    interleaves JSON `{"type":"status", detector:{…}}` frames at <=1 Hz;
    emits `{"type":"eof"}` once when a file source reaches end;
    emits `{"type":"event", id, frame_pos, ts, prompt, text}` for each
    VLM detection result.
- **Service** (`app/services/video_session.py`):
  - One `VideoSession` singleton, one `rkv.VideoCapture`, one decode
    `Thread`. Latest-frame-only queue (`maxsize=1`) — drops oldest on
    overflow to keep latency low.
  - Frame sinks: registered callbacks are called on each decoded BGR
    frame (used by the detector). Sinks must not raise.
  - Lazy `from rkv import VideoCapture` at module top (still behind the
    `try/except` from `rkv/__init__.py`); never imports `rkv.video`
    explicitly.
- **Service** (`app/services/detector.py`):
  - `RkaiDetector` singleton. Wraps `rkai.LLMSession` with
    `SystemLanguageModel.qwen3_vl_4b()` (configurable via
    `RKAI_MODELS_DIR`).
  - **rkai is imported lazily** at `start()` time — not at module load.
    Loading the RKNN native libs eagerly at app startup caused a
    segfault on this dev box (RKNN3 init races with rkv's mpp
    bring-up). Don't move the import back to module top.
  - One daemon worker thread consumes a `queue.Queue(maxsize=1)`
    (latest-only); the decode-loop sink drops whatever's pending and
    replaces it with the freshest frame so the detector always sees
    the most recent state.
  - Each inference calls `session.reset()` (clears history + KV cache)
    and `session.respond(msg, attachment=Attachment(frame))` — free-text
    response, no schema. ~1s after model warm-up.
  - History is an in-memory deque (max 200). Events carry `id`, `frame_pos`,
    `ts`, `prompt`, `text`.
  - On app shutdown, `close()` releases the RKNN session handle.
- **Frontend** (`app/static/js/app.js` + `#page-video-detection` markup):
  - Address input + "浏览设备…" button (opens server-side file picker
    modal) + "打开" / "关闭" buttons. The picker modal drives
    `/api/video-detection/fs` and writes the **device's** absolute path
    back into the address input — paths come from the server's
    filesystem, not the user's laptop.
  - `<canvas>` rendered from binary WS frames; auto-reconnecting WS with
    exponential backoff.
  - Play / Pause / Stop / Replay, status line, animated progress bar for
    live streams.
  - Below the video: prompt textarea + "每隔 N 帧检测一次" input + 启动/停止
    buttons + status text + 历史事件列表. Each new event also pops
    a `vd-event-badge` overlay on top of the canvas (auto-dismiss
    after 6s).

`app/api/__init__.py` must import each submodule (`from . import power, …`)
so `app.include_router(...)` in `main.py` actually sees them — without it
the package object is empty and the routes are silently missing.

## Configuration

The service reads a single JSON-object `config.json` from disk and
holds it in memory. The file is seeded with a `base` section at
`{}` + future sections stacked alongside it.

- **Where it lives** — resolved from `PYRKAIWEB_CONFIG` env var when
  `run.py` starts (set by `--config /path/to/config.json`); if unset,
  defaults to `<repo>/config.json`. Always absolute.
- **Read-write** — `app/services/config.py` `ConfigStore` is a lazy
  singleton (`get_config()`) with an in-memory dict guarded by an
  `RLock`. Missing files / non-object payloads all collapse to `{}`.
- **Atomic writes** — `replace()` / `set_section()` write a sibling
  temp file and `os.replace()`-s into place so a crash mid-write
  can't corrupt the file.
- **Whole-file endpoints** (`app/api/config.py`):
  - `GET  /api/config`        — `{path, data}` (current snapshot).
  - `GET  /api/config/export` — `FileResponse` of the on-disk file
    (downloads as `config.json`). If the file doesn't exist yet,
    the endpoint writes `{}` first so the download always succeeds.
  - `POST /api/config/import` — `multipart/form-data` upload (field
    name `file`). Validates UTF-8, JSON parse, top-level object —
    rejects empty bodies, lists, scalars with HTTP 400.
- **Section endpoints** — `GET /api/config/{section}` reads a
  top-level key (e.g. `base`) and fills in missing fields with
  Pydantic defaults; `PUT /api/config/{section}` replaces just that
  key without disturbing siblings. Other sections (e.g. a future
  `power`) stay intact across `base` edits.
- **`base` section** (Pydantic model `BaseConfig` in
  `app/api/config.py`) currently has one field:
  - `model_path` — absolute directory where RKNN model weights live
    (default `/userdata/models/`). Validated as non-empty +
    starts-with-`/`; the GET/PUT responses also include a
    `model_path_exists` boolean for the UI to surface a soft warning
    (the save doesn't create the directory).
- **UI** — gear button (`#config-btn`) sits next to the power button
  at the bottom-left of the sidebar. Opens a popover with 导出配置 /
  导入配置 (export / import) and the live config file path at the
  bottom. Import fires a hidden `<input type="file">`; export
  fetches the file as a blob and triggers a download. Popover and
  power popover are mutually exclusive (opening one closes the other
  — they share the same anchor and would otherwise stack).
- **Base config page** — second sidebar entry (`#base-config`),
  driven by the `Base` module in `app/static/js/app.js`. GETs the
  `base` section on entry, PUTs on submit; "放弃修改" re-fetches.
  Services downstream (e.g. the detector's model loader) read
  `get_config().get_section("base")["model_path"]` lazily, not at
  import time, so a saved change takes effect on the next request.
- **`RKAI_MODELS_DIR` propagation** — `app/main.py` reads
  `base.model_path` at `create_app()` time and writes it into
  `os.environ["RKAI_MODELS_DIR"]` before any `LLMSession` is built.
  rkai's `_models_root()` reads that env var on first call, so the
  SDK picks up the configured root automatically. Changing the
  field via the UI after the app has booted only takes effect on
  the next uvicorn reload (i.e. after a restart in production) —
  an already-loaded `LLMSession` was bound to the old path.
- **Frontend modules** — `ConfigMenu` (popover), `Base` (form page);
  `PowerMenu` was untouched and is mutually exclusive with
  `ConfigMenu` via the `_wrapOpenToCloseOther` helper.

## System logs page

The `#page-system-logs` section is wired to `app/api/system_logs.py`,
which shells out to `journalctl` and pipes JSON-lines back:

- `GET /api/system-logs/units` — service list (running / failed /
  exited / activating) + priority whitelist. Populates the unit
  dropdown so the UI never hardcodes a name.
- `GET /api/system-logs?unit=&priority=&lines=` — last N entries.
  `unit` is matched against a strict regex (`[A-Za-z0-9_.@:-]{1,128}`),
  `priority` is whitelisted, `lines` is clamped to 2000 — none of these
  reach a shell.
- `WS /api/system-logs/ws?unit=&priority=` — `journalctl -n 100 -f`
  driven by `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec`. Lines stream as
  `{"type":"line","entry":{...}}`; auto-terminates after 30 minutes
  per connection; pings every 15 s so idle proxies don't reap.

Frontend (`app/static/js/app.js` `Logs` module): filter toolbar (unit +
  priority + lines + follow-tail checkbox + clear), `<ol>` list of color-coded
  log rows on a dark stage, auto-scroll only when the user is parked at
  the bottom (so scrolling up to inspect an older line doesn't get yanked).
  Journalctl outputs `MESSAGE` as a list-of-bytes for some services
  (rknn3, etc.); `_normalize()` decodes with `errors="replace"` so the
  page never 500s on a binary blob.

## Gotchas

- **No lint / typecheck / test / CI config exists yet.** Do not invent
  `ruff`/`mypy`/`pytest` invocations — there is nothing to run, and adding
  config requires a decision the user hasn't made.
- **Reload mode picks up `.venv/src/` edits** because the editable installs
  live there. Editing rkv/rkai source via Uvicorn reload is fine; the
  installed metadata is in `.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/`.
- **`run.py` defaults to `reload=True` and port 8000** — fine for dev, but
  disable reload (`uvicorn.run(..., reload=False)`) before any production
  command, or use `uvicorn app.main:app` directly.
- **rkv hardware path requires a Rockchip target.** If `import rkv.video`
  raises on this machine, it's expected — the SDK falls back gracefully for
  bare `import rkv`. Don't suppress the fallback.
- **Imports should stay lazy** for `rkv.video` / `rkai.*` so a non-target
  dev box can still boot the web shell.
- **`RkaiDetector._load_rkai()` must stay lazy**. The module-top import of
  `rkai.Attachment / LLMSession / SystemLanguageModel` will pull in
  RKNN3 native libs at app startup, racing with rkv's mpp init and
  segfaulting on this dev box. Keep the import behind `_load_rkai()`,
  which is called from `start()` / `_ensure_session()`.
- **`VideoSession.open()` event ordering matters.** Always `_teardown()`
  before clearing `_stop_event` / setting `_play_event` — teardown flips
  both into the "stopped" state, so doing it the other way leaves the new
  decode thread seeing `_stop_event.is_set() == True` and exiting on
  iteration 1 (silent: state stays "playing", `frame_pos` stays 0, no
  frames ever appear on the WS).
- **RTSP/RTMP/HLS work via the same `/open` endpoint** — `VideoCapture`
  routes anything containing `://` through PyAV. The frontend just shows
  the URL in the address bar; no client-side protocol branching needed.
- **Seek/scrub is intentionally not implemented yet.** `VideoCapture`
  doesn't expose a `set(1, frame_pos)` API; plumbing one in means
  touching `self._container` internals. The progress bar is currently
  read-only and animates only for live sources.

## TTS (语音生成) page

The `#page-tts` section drives Qwen3-TTS through the SDK's
``TTSBackend`` (defined under
``.venv/src/rkai/src/rkai/backends/tts.py`, which wraps the
upstream ``Qwen3TTSDemo`` from
``rknn3-toolkit-lite/examples/Qwen3-TTS/qwen3_tts_demo.py``).
The model layout, .1828.rknn naming, and AudioPlayer streaming
path are all documented in ``.venv/src/rkai/src/rkai/models/README.md``
and ``.venv/src/rkai/src/rkai/backends/tts.py``.

* **Service** (`app/services/tts_session.py`):
  - ``TtsSession`` singleton, lazy-imports rkai at first use so a
    non-RK dev box still boots (just reports ``state="unavailable"``).
  - State machine mirrors ``VideoSession``/``RkaiDetector``:
    ``idle → start() → loading → running → done/error/stopped``.
    The state transitions are broadcast over ``/api/tts/ws``.
  - One daemon worker thread per request. The worker forwards
    ``stop_event`` to the SDK so a stop issued during prefill or
    decode unwinds the RKNN sessions cleanly; ``stop()`` flips the
    state immediately so the UI is responsive while the worker
    thread is still draining.
  - Output history is an in-memory deque (max 50). Each entry:
    ``{ts, text, language, speaker, output, size, audio_sec, frames}``.
* **Endpoints** (`app/api/tts.py`):
  - ``POST /api/tts/start`` ``{text, language, speaker, ref_speaker,
    volume, instruct, no_play, non_streaming_mode, output}`` — kicks
    off a synthesis. Refuses with 503 if a run is in flight.
  - ``POST /api/tts/stop`` — flips state to ``stopped`` immediately
    and propagates ``stop_event`` to the SDK.
  - ``GET  /api/tts`` — current snapshot (state / available / frames
    / audio_sec / elapsed / output / error / request / history_count).
  - ``GET  /api/tts/history`` — list of recent output WAVs.
  - ``WS   /api/tts/ws`` — pushes the snapshot on every state /
    frames / error change. Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff
    is handled on the client side (``app/static/js/app.js``
    ``TTS.ensureWs``).
* **Frontend** (``app/static/index.html`` + ``#page-tts`` markup):
  - Sidebar entry ``语音生成`` sits between ``视频检测`` and
    ``系统日志`` (mutually exclusive with other pages — the sidebar
    just toggles the ``.hidden`` class on each ``.page``).
  - Textarea + speaker/language selectors + volume slider (default
    30%, range 0–100, step 5; the label mirrors the slider value
    live via the ``input`` event).
  - Start / Stop buttons, status line, history list below. Cmd/Ctrl
    + Enter inside the textarea fires 开始生成.

**Volume semantics** — the slider value is passed straight through to
the SDK as the linear amplitude scale (``chunk *= volume`` on the
decoded float32 PCM). A slider of 0.5 is 0.5 amplitude, no
perceptual curve. The web default is 0.1 so the played PCM starts
at ~10% on hardware whose mixers default to 100% — crank the slider
to taste.

**Output WAV format** — 24 kHz, mono, 32-bit IEEE float (format tag
3, matching the C++ demo). Python's stdlib ``wave`` can't read
format-3; for inspection, use ``soundfile.read(...)`` or parse the
RIFF header by hand.
